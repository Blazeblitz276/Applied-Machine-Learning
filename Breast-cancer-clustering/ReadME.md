## Dataset

The dataset used is the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset, which can be obtained from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)).

## Tasks

1. **K-Means Clustering Implementation:** Implement K-Means clustering from scratch.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Load the dataset and preprocess it.
3. **Clustering without Labels:** Perform clustering without using class labels and evaluate accuracy.
4. **Multiple Runs Analysis:** Analyze results with different initial centers.
5. **Supervised Method Comparison:** Compare results with a supervised method like Logistic Regression.

## Requirements

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install <requirements>
```
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Breast_cancer_clustering.ipynb
```
